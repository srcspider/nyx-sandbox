/// Wanted to keep things simple; since square is just 2 triangles, kept this
/// experiment to a classic "hello, triangle". Less variables to edit when 
/// mutating it to see what different paramters such as draw mode do.
///
/// Used this to get a better understanding of how to just draw a frame; the
/// technical details are understandable but seem to just not connect; hence
/// why I wrote the example.
///
/// Probably everyone when they start out wants to draw 3D object like a sphere
/// or a plain, but by god do books and various other technically competent 
/// sources take ages to get thereâ€”no suprise why though.

    ///    needs to be told we're done and that it should re-render. By calling
